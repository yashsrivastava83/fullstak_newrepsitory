    <p>Thor: Ragnarok has been touted as the Thor trilogy, and it's not hard to see why. Taking over from Kenneth Branagh and Alan Taylor, Taika Waititi adds a touch of weird to the God of Thunder's adventures. Add Taika's unique, zany style to a fun story, fun characters, and plenty of action, and we've got a memorable conclusion to Thor's solo series.</p>
